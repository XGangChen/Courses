Please design your own non-linear system with local asymptotic stability (non-linear system should be designed by yourself) and complete the following tasks.

(1) Find the equilibrium points of the system.

(2) Linearize the system around the equilibrium points.

(3) Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points using the linearized system

(4) Find a Lyapunov function.

   (a) Krasovskii’s method

   (b) The Variable Gradient Method

(5) Plot a Lyapunov function using MATLAB

(6) Plot state trajectories of the system with Lyapunov function near the origin using MATLAB.

(7) Show the origin is stable using Lyapunov’s direct method.

(8) Show the origin is asymptotically stable using Invariant set theorem.

(9) Performance analysis of the system.
